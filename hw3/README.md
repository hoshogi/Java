# 과제 3
- 간단한 공연예약 시스템을 만들어보시오.
1. 공연은 하루에 한번 있다.
2. 좌석은 S타입 10석, A타입 15석, B타입 20석이 있다.
3. 시스템의 메뉴는 "예약", "검색", "취소", "끝내기"가 있다.
4. 예약은 1자리만 예약할 수 있으며 좌석 타입, 예약자 이름, 좌석 번호를 순서대로 입력받아 예약한다.
5. 검색은 모든 종류의 좌석을 표시한다.
6. 취소는 예약자의 이름을 입력하여 취소한다.
7. 없는 이름, 없는 번호, 없는 메뉴, 잘못된 취소 등에 대해서 오류메시지를 출력하고 사용자가 다시 입력하도록 한다.
8. 클래스 3개를 사용한다. Reserve 클래스, SeatType 클래스, Seat 클래스를 사용하여 구현한다.
